Toughkey SDK for Android</h1>

<h2 class="western">What is a Toughkey?</h2><br/>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">The Toughkey is a
device that offers advanced security and flexibility for various
applications that can store and process information, and provide
security and authentication for various applications and uses
cryptography to perform functions such as encryption, decryption,
digital signature, and key management. It is based on proven and
reliable security hardened IC platform, which demonstrates worldwide
interoperability and standard compliance. It has advanced integrated
security architecture which provides physical and logical protection
against various attacks, such as side-channel analysis, fault
injection, and reverse engineering. It has a CC EAL 6+ certification,
which is the highest level of security assurance for smart card
products. It supports multiple applications and protocols, such as
EMV, ISO/IEC 7816, ISO/IEC 14443, and Global Platform. It uses a JCOP
4 operating system, which is a JavaCard 3.0.5 compliant platform that
enables fast and easy development of secure applications.</p>

<h2 class="western">What does a Toughkey look like?</h2>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Toughkeys can have
different form factors, depending on the application and the user
preference. The most common form factor is the credit card size,
which is standardized by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) as ID-1. Another form factor is the USB token,
which is a smart card that can be plugged into a USB port of a
computer or a mobile device. Both form factors support contact and
contactless operation. Contact Toughkeys have a set of metal contacts
on the surface that connect to the reader device when inserted or
have a built in reader device and USB connector. Contactless
Toughkeys use radio frequency (RF) or near field communication (NFC)
technology to communicate with the reader device without physical
contact. 
</p>

<h2 class="western">What can you do with a Toughkey?</h2>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Toughkey contains a
PKI applet that provides a secure and flexible solution for storing
and managing cryptographic keys and certificates. It supports up to
4096 bit RSA and 521 bit ECC keys, as well as 256 bit AES keys, for
various cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption,
digital signature, and key management. It has a built-in PKI for
remote management, which allows you to create, update, delete, and
backup keys and certificates over a secure channel. It has a CC EAL
6+ certification, which is the highest level of security assurance
for smart card products, and ensures that the applet is resistant to
various physical and logical attacks. 
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Toughkey supports
split knowledge for the generation and backup of keys and
certificates on the device, using a secure channel and a PIN or PUK
codes. The keys and certificates are never exposed outside the
device, and can only be used by authorized applications.</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Toughkey supports
key attestation by using a built-in public key infrastructure (PKI)
for device authentication and a unique device certificate issued by a
certification authority. The device certificate contains information
about the device model, serial number, firmware version, and
supported algorithms. Toughkey also supports card verifiable
certificates (CVCs) as defined in BSI TR-03110, which is a standard
for electronic identity documents such as passports and national eID
cards. CVCs are self-signed certificates that can be verified by
other devices that share the same root certificate. CVCs can be used
to attest the keys generated on a Toughkey and to establish a secure
channel for remote key generation and certificate issuance.</p>

<h2 class="western">How do you use Toughkey on Android?</h2>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Android phone that
supports NFC (Near Field Communication) can act as a reader device
for contactless smart cards, as well as a host device for other
NFC-enabled devices. To use a Toughkey with an Android phone that
supports NFC, you need to follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
        <li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Make sure your
        Android phone has NFC enabled and supports the ISO 14443 protocol.
        You can check this in the Settings app under Connected devices &gt;
        Connection preferences &gt; NFC.</p>
        <li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Use this SDK to
        create an app on your Android device that can communicate with the
        Toughkey.</p>
        <li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Launch the app
        and enter a PIN or a password to access the PKI applet, depending on
        the security settings for the services you require.</p>
        <li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Perform the
        desired operation using the PKI applet, such as signing a document,
        encrypting an email, or authenticating to a website. The Toughkey
        library will send commands to Toughkey using the APDU (Application
        Protocol Data Unit) format, which is defined by the ISO 7816
        standard. Toughkey will respond with the appropriate data or status
        code, which the app will display or process accordingly.</p>
