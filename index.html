<h2 id="what-is-a-toughkey-">What is a Toughkey?</h2>
<p>The Toughkey is a device that offers advanced flexible security and authentication services for applications that can store and process information, and uses cryptography to perform functions such as encryption, decryption, digital signature, and key management. It is based on the NXP proven and reliable security hardened IC platform, which demonstrates worldwide interoperability and standard compliance. It has advanced integrated security architecture which provides physical and logical protection against various attacks, such as side-channel analysis, fault injection, and reverse engineering. It has a CC EAL 6+ certification, which is the highest level of security assurance for smart card products. It supports multiple applications and protocols, such as EMV, ISO/IEC 7816, ISO/IEC 14443, and Global Platform. It uses a JCOP 4 operating system, which is a JavaCard 3.0.5 compliant platform that enables fast and easy development of secure applications. </p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-toughkey-look-like-">What does a Toughkey look like?</h2>
<p>Toughkeys can have different form factors, depending on the application and the user preference. The most common form factor is the credit card size, which is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ID-1. Another form factor is the USB token, which is a smart card chip that is integrated with a USB connector that can be plugged into a USB port of a computer or a mobile device. Both form factors support contact and contactless operation. Contact Toughkeys have a set of metal contacts on the surface that connect to the reader device when inserted or have a built in reader device and USB connector. Contactless Toughkeys use radio frequency (RF) or near field communication (NFC) technology to communicate with the reader device without physical contact. </p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-a-toughkey-">What can you do with a Toughkey?</h2>
<p>Toughkey contains a PKI applet that provides a secure and flexible solution for storing and managing cryptographic keys and certificates. It supports up to 4096 bit RSA and 521 bit ECC keys, as well as 256 bit AES keys, for various cryptographic operations such as encryption, decryption, digital signature, and key management. It has a built-in PKI for remote management, which allows you to create, update, delete, and backup keys and certificates over a secure channel. It has a CC EAL 6+ certified platform, which ensures that the applet is resistant to various physical and logical attacks. </p>
<p>Toughkey supports cryptographic split knowledge, a process where the key is split into multiple components and individually share nothing of the original key, for the generation and backup of keys and certificates on the device, using a secure channel and a PIN or PUK codes. The keys are never exposed outside the device and can only be used by authorized applications. </p>
<p>Toughkey supports key attestation by using a built-in public key infrastructure (PKI) for device authentication and a unique device certificate issued by a certification authority. The device certificate contains information about the device model, serial number, firmware version, and supported algorithms. Toughkey also supports card verifiable certificates (CVCs) as defined in BSI TR-03110, which is a standard for electronic identity documents such as passports and national eID cards. CVCs are self-signed certificates that can be verified by other devices that share the same root certificate. CVCs can be used to attest the keys generated on a Toughkey and to establish a secure channel for remote key generation and certificate issuance. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-use-toughkey-on-android-">How do you use Toughkey on Android?</h2>
<p>Android mobile devices that supports NFC (Near Field Communication) can act as a reader device for contactless smart cards, as well as a host device for other NFC-enabled devices. To use a Toughkey with an Android phone that supports NFC, you need to follow these steps: </p>
<ul>
        <li>Make sure your Android device has NFC enabled and supports the ISO 14443 protocol. You can check this in the Settings app under Connected devices &gt; Connection preferences &gt; NFC. </li>
        <li>Use this SDK to create an app on your Android device that can communicate with the Toughkey. </li>
        <li>Launch the app and enter a PIN or a password to access the PKI applet, depending on the security settings for the services you require. </li>
        <li>Perform the desired operation using the PKI applet, such as signing a document, encrypting an email, or authenticating to a website. The Toughkey library will send commands to Toughkey using the APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) format, which is defined by the ISO 7816 standard. Toughkey will respond with the appropriate data or status code, which the app will display or process accordingly. </li>
</ul>

        <p>NOTE: This version 0.1 of Toughkey SDK for Android supports retrieving data objects that have been loaded on a Toughkey using the PKCS11 library on Windows/Linux/MacOS desktop systems. Future releases will support: </p>
        <ul>
                <li>adding and removing objects</li>
                <li>cryptographic APIâ€™s for signing, encrypting, etc.</li>
                <li>remote attestation</li>
                <li>key backup and recovery</li>
